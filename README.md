# RERUM API v1
A NodeJS web service for interaction with the RERUM digital object repository.
Visit [rerum.io](https://rerum.io) for more general information.
Want to use the API?  Learn how at the [API page](https://store.rerum.io/v1/API.html).

Stores important bits of knowledge in structured JSON-LD objects:

* Web Annotation / Open Annotation objects
* SharedCanvas / International Image Interoperability Framework objects
* FOAF Agents
* _any_ valid JSON object, even if there is no type specified!

## Basic Principles

1. **As RESTful as is reasonable**‚Äîaccept and respond to a broad range of requests without losing the map;
1. **As compliant as is practical**‚Äîtake advantage of standards and harmonize conflicts;
1. **Save an object, retrieve an object**‚Äîstore metadata in private (`__rerum`) property, rather than wrap all data transactions;
1. **Trust the application, not the user**‚Äîavoid multiple login and authentication requirements and honor open data attributions;
1. **Open and Free**‚Äîexpose all contributions immediately without charge to write or read;
1. **Attributed and Versioned**‚Äîalways include asserted ownership and transaction metadata so consumers can evaluate trustworthiness and relevance.

## What we add

You will find a `__rerum` property on anything you read from this repository. This is written onto
all objects by the server and is not editable by the client applications. While applications may assert
_anything_ within their objects, this property will always tell the Truth. The details are in the
documentation, but broadly, you will find:

* `@context`   the RERUM API JSON-LD context file for these terms
* `alpha`  internal flag for RERUM API version control 
* `APIversion` specific RERUM API release version for this data node
* `createdAt`  specific creation date for this \[version of this] object
* `generatedBy`  the agent for the application that authenticated to create this object
* `isOverwritten`  specific date (if any) this version was updated without versioning
* `isReleased`  a special flag for RERUM, indicating this version is intentionally public and immutable
* `releases`  an object containing the most recent anscestor and descendant releases
* `history`  an object containing the first, previous, and immediate derivative versions of this object

### Default Installation
The following is a git shell example for installing the RERUM API web application.

#### Get a MongoDB Database
Check out [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database) for a cloud hosted solution as well as instructions for installing MongoDB on your development machines.

#### Get the Code
```shell
cd /code_folder
git clone https://github.com/CenterForDigitalHumanities/rerum_server_nodejs.git rerum_api
npm install
```

#### Create the Configuration File
Create a file named `.env` in the root folder.  In the above example, the root is `/code_folder/tiny_things`.  `/code_folder/tiny_things/.env` looks like this:

```shell
RERUM_API_VERSION = 1.0.0
RERUM_BASE = URL_OF_YOUR_DEPLOYMENT
RERUM_PREFIX = URL_OF_YOUR_DEPLOYMENT/v1/
RERUM_ID_PREFIX = URL_OF_YOUR_DEPLOYMENT/v1/id/
RERUM_AGENT_CLAIM = URL_OF_YOUR_DEPLOYMENT/agent
RERUM_CONTEXT = URL_OF_YOUR_DEPLOYMENT/v1/context.json
RERUM_API_DOC = URL_OF_YOUR_DEPLOYMENT/v1/API.html
MONGO_CONNECTION_STRING = OBTAINED_FROM_MONGODB_SET_UP
MONGODBNAME = OBTAINED_FROM_MONGODB_SET_UP
MONGODBCOLLECTION = OBTAINED_FROM_MONGODB_SET_UP
DOWN = false
READONLY = false
```

Now, you can run tests
```shell
npm run runtest
```

And start the app
```shell
npm start
```

To stop the application, kill or exit the process via your shell (<kbd>CTRL + C</kbd> or <kbd>CTRL + X</kbd>).

The public RERUM uses Auth0 to authorize API calls for registered RERUM applications and to attribute data for those applications.  This elicits the functionality that if an application has not registered with RERUM it will not be able to perform write (create - update - delete) actions with the RERUM API.  It also allows queries into RERUM to query for data specific to individual applications when desired or required.  If this is not a requirement for your instance of RERUM perform the following steps
- Remove the `/auth` directory
- Remove `auth.checkJwt` throughout the script files in the `/routes` directory
- We recommend you replace the documentation and functionality around `generatedBy` as opposed to removing it.
  
Now your instance of RERUM will not depend on a connection to Auth0 and your installation is complete.

### Advanced Installation

If you would like authorization for your instance of RERUM begin by adding the following properties to your `.env` file.

```shell
AUDIENCE = OBTAINED_FROM_AUTH0_SET_UP
ISSUER_BASE_URL = OBTAINED_FROM_AUTH0_SET_UP
CLIENTID = OBTAINED_FROM_AUTH0_SET_UP
RERUMSECRET = OBTAINED_FROM_AUTH0_SET_UP
BOT_TOKEN = OBTAINED_FROM_BOT_REGISTRATION
BOT_AGENT = OBTAINED_FROM_BOT_REGISTRATION
```

#### Set Up an Auth0 Authorization Flow
Start by setting up the standard Auth0 Authorization Flow.

- That
- The Other
  
#### Create and Assign a RERUM Bot
The RERUM bot is a special agent that has access to private functionality.  It is the first "user" for RERUM.  You create a bot by manually creating your first User in Auth0.  Once you have created an Auth0 User, you will need to manually generate a RERUM Agent for that user and add that Agent URI to the Auth0 User metadata.  Now when you log in to Auth0 with that user you will get an Access Token for that user with the RERUM Agent encoded in the token.  That Access Token will work forever.  It's main usage is as the "Bearer Token" for end-to-end tests so that API calls during the tests do not recieve a "401 Unauthorized" response.  It also allows the registration process to generate a RERUM Agent as the bot will be allowed to do the create action necessary to save the Agent into the RERUM database.  That means you won't have to do this manually each time an app is registered.

#### Create an Action to Generate a RERUM Agent Upon Sign Up

- That
- The Other

## Who is to blame?
The developers in the Research Computing Group at Saint Louis University authored and maintain this service.
Neither specific warranty or rights are associated with RERUM; registering and contributing implies only those rights 
each object asserts about itself. We welcome sister instances of RERUM, ports to other languages, package managers, builds, etc.
